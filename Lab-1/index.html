        <p id="art1-text">Hello! My name is Mario and I'm a second-year computer
          science student. Of all the software development disciplines, I find frontend
          development to be the most interesting. At the moment I am tailoring my coursework to cover the type of 
          work that a frontend developer would do. In my free time, I enjoy going out with my friends, 
          playing video games, and reading books.

        <h4>Due: Feb 14</h4> 
        <p>Your course jump page will function as a landing page for 
          the complete work of this course. The page must clearly display 
          your personal intro, and the details for each project 
          and practice lab.

        <h4>Due: Mar 9</h4> 
        <p>Create an image gallery with no less than 10 images. 
          The UI should function in a  progressively enhanced manner. 
          Your gallery layout remains attractive and accessible 
          with JavaScript turned off.

        <h4>Due: Apr 13</h4> 
        <p>This project focuses on the presentation of rich media such as 
          audio and video. What makes this assignment different from a 
          typical audio or video web player is the media will be used to 
          control the UI to augment the content of the rich media.

        <h2>Lab 1: Layout</h2>
        <p>Make a copy of the review assignment folder and add the page layout features 
          defined in your previous defined page sketch. Use Flexbox and CSS Grid to 
          create the page layout. The page should remain responsive, and the design 
          should not suffer through resizing.

        <p>For this exercise we create a new webpage from scratch. It will focus on mouse 
          events, but we will discuss other types of event types as well.

        <p>Our first large project will be to create a custom image gallery. Before we can 
          create that project, we need to understand how to use JavaScript to dynamically 
          change what the viewer can see.

        <p>The third project in this class is to create a rich media player. 
          This media player will not only play audio and/or video files, 
          it will also use those media files as a catalyst to enact change on 
          the web page itself.

          method to be proper semantic html with classes for CSS hooks. In this second part, 
          you will write the code necessary to fetch a random color from this 
          free and open API.

        <p> Find at least two free APIs that have both clear documentation and 
          interesting data. Following the documentation for the APIs, create a web 
          page that displays data from each API in a way that makes sense and ideally
           connects each data set together in an interesting way.

        <p>Using the previous Lab assignment (Lab 6: Fun with APIs) as a starting point. Store 
          the fetched data in the browser so that your mini-app will still function 
          in a limited way.
